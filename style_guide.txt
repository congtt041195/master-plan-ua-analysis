1. Global Streamlit Layout
The current UI uses a sidebar for inputs and a wide main area. Keep that, but clean up the "Data Upload" section.

Custom CSS: Inject a small bit of CSS to remove the default padding and style the metric cards to look more "Apple-like" and less "Bootstrap."

The "Context" Header: Use st.title() for the big picture, but immediately follow it with an st.info() or a simple st.markdown() that explains the primary takeaway (e.g., "Performance is pacing 12% ahead of target").

2. The Plotly "SWD" Theme
By default, Plotly adds a lot of "ink." Use this configuration object in your code to declutter your charts:

Python
# Create a reusable template for your SWD style
swd_template = {
    "layout": {
        "plot_bgcolor": "rgba(0,0,0,0)",
        "paper_bgcolor": "rgba(0,0,0,0)",
        "font": {"family": "Inter, sans-serif", "color": "#4A5568"},
        "xaxis": {"showgrid": False, "linecolor": "#E2E8F0"},
        "yaxis": {"showgrid": True, "gridcolor": "#EDF2F7", "zeroline": False},
        "margin": {"t": 40, "l": 0, "r": 20, "b": 40},
        "hovermode": "closest",
    }
}
3. Redesigning the "ROAS & Profit" Chart
Instead of three competing colors, focus on the Gap between Revenue and Cost.

The Baseline: Make the Total Cost line a solid, thin Medium Gray (#718096). It’s the benchmark, not the star.

The Hero: Make the Cumulative Revenue line a Deep Blue (#2B6CB0) and slightly thicker.

The Annotation: Use Plotly’s .add_annotation() to label the Break-Even point exactly where it happens. Don't make the user look at a legend; put the text "Break Even (D174)" right on the dot.

4. Code Implementation (The "Vibe" Code)
Here is how you would structure your Plotly figure in Python to match this aesthetic:

Python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import streamlit as st

def create_ua_chart(df):
    fig = go.Figure()

    # 1. Background/Benchmark Line (Cost)
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=df['day'], y=df['total_cost'],
        name="Total Cost",
        line=dict(color='#A0AEC0', width=2, dash='dot'),
        hovertemplate="Cost: $%{y:,.0f}<extra></extra>"
    ))

    # 2. Hero Line (Revenue)
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=df['day'], y=df['cum_revenue'],
        name="Cumulative Revenue",
        line=dict(color='#2B6CB0', width=4),
        hovertemplate="Revenue: $%{y:,.0f}<extra></extra>"
    ))

    # 3. Direct Labeling (SWD Principle)
    # Label the end of the lines instead of a legend
    fig.add_annotation(
        x=df['day'].iloc[-1], y=df['cum_revenue'].iloc[-1],
        text="Revenue", xanchor="left", showarrow=False, xshift=10
    )

    # 4. Highlight the Break-Even Point
    be_day = 174 # Calculate this dynamically
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=[be_day], y=[df.loc[df['day'] == be_day, 'cum_revenue'].values[0]],
        mode='markers+text',
        marker=dict(color='#E53E3E', size=10),
        text=["Break Even"], textposition="top center"
    ))

    fig.update_layout(template=swd_template, showlegend=False)
    return fig

st.plotly_chart(create_ua_chart(data), use_container_width=True)
5. Metric Cards with Delta Logic
In your current UI, the metrics are a bit flat. Use Streamlit’s native st.metric but apply the "SWD" logic: only use color for the delta (change).

Main Value: Black/Dark Gray.

Delta: Red/Green based on whether it's beating the forecast.

Context: Use st.caption below the metric to explain what the number means (e.g., "14% increase vs last cohort").

6. Checklist for "Vibe" Success
[ ] Delete the Legend: If you only have 2 lines, label them directly or use the chart title to explain the colors.

[ ] Mute the Grid: Change gridcolor to a very light gray or hide it.

[ ] No Borders: Ensure the st.container or card doesn't have a heavy black border. Use a 1px #E2E8F0 border or a soft shadow.

[ ] Smart Rounding: Don't show $323,445.79 if $323k conveys the same story. SWD is about reducing "noise."
